    "# LAND PRICE PREDICTION APP USING AWS SAGEMAKER'S IN-BUILT XGBOOST  - End-to-End\n",
    "We will build a Land Price Prediction App to help people looking to buy land in Cameroon, get the expected price of land per quartier they intend to buy land from.\n",
    "The following steps will be taken:\n",
    "- I)   PROBLEM STATEMENT:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people in Cameroon want to buy lands and they have trouble getting information on what to expect as price per square metre for the quartier they want to buy the land from.They also want to be able to consult the prices of several quartiers before making their final choice.\n",
    "This is a difficult process in Cameroon as it will mean these people who want to buy lands will have to go about making many phone calls to people asking them the price of land in those quartiers.\n",
    "So the objective is to scrape the data already available on the biggest Classified adds website in Cameroon (Jumia Cameroon) https://www.jumia.cm/en/land-plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will be cleaned and trained using the in-built XGBoost Algorithm on AWS Sagemaker, and an endpoint will be created in AWS ,which wll be used to make predictions when given the inputs like \n",
    "- The Quartier the customer wants to buy land from\n",
    "- The size of the land the customer intends to buy (in metres square)\n",
    "- And the output of the model will be the predicted Price per metres square for the Quartier the customer requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- II)   SCRAPING THE DATA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrape the data from a Classified ads website, where people post lands for sale per quartier in Cameroon.They typically type in the price per metres square and the total area of the land availlable for sale.\n",
    "- III)  PERFORM EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the data to validate the quality of the data scraped from the classified ads website. Analyse the distribution of missing values, outliers and gain other relevant insights from the model\n",
    "- IV) DO FEATURE ENGINEERING & SELECTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle the mising values, outliers and do the necessary transformations which will ensure the data is well suited for the machine learning model.And also to maximise the insights gotten from the Exploratory Data Analysis phase.\n",
    "- V)  BUILD,TRAIN AND DEPLOY THE MODEL IN SAGEMAKER\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boto3 Container will be used to create the S3 buckets to store the preprocessed dataset.The Sagemaker's inbuilt XGBoost algorithm, will be built, trained and deployed.Including the use of optimal hyperparameters to get the best results for the RMSE( Root Mean Squared Error).An Endpoint will be created after the model is built.\n",
    "The Endpoint created awill be used to predict the price per metre square when the inputs of \"Quartier\" and \"Land size\" are fed to the endpoint."
